Tableau homework for the UO data bootcamp

There is a jupiter notebook showing some of my intial effort to reduce the csv to one bike only. My idea was to create an animation showing the progress of one
bike through time.

That ended up being a bridge too far. So what we have are two dash boards. One with a trip duration vs age of rider graph another with a trip duration and location graph.
Basically, who rode for longer and where did they go. The second is a time of day and trip duration graph and a individual bike and sum of trip duration graph. The idea
being how old are the riders doing the most riding. And at what time of day are peole riding the longest.
